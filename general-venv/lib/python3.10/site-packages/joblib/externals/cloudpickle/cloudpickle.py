"""Pickler class to extend the standard pickle.Pickler functionality

The main objective is to make it natural to perform distributed computing on
clusters (such as PySpark, Dask, Ray...) with interactively defined code
(functions, classes, ...) written in notebooks or console.

In particular this pickler adds the following features:
- serialize interactively-defined or locally-defined functions, classes,
  enums, typevars, lambdas and nested functions to compiled byte code;
- deal with some other non-serializable objects in an ad-hoc manner where
  applicable.

This pickler is therefore meant to be used for the communication between short
lived Python processes running the same version of Python and libraries. In
particular, it is not meant to be used for long term storage of Python objects.

It does not include an unpickler, as standard Python unpickling suffices.
=======
"""
This class is defined to override standard pickle functionality

The goals of it follow:
-Serialize lambdas and nested functions to compiled byte code
-Deal with main module correctly
-Deal with other non-serializable objects

It does not include an unpickler, as standard python unpickling suffices.

def cell_set(cell, value):
    """Set the value of a closure cell.

    The point of this function is to set the cell_contents attribute of a cell
    after its creation. This operation is necessary in case the cell contains a
    reference to the function the cell belongs to, as when calling the
    function's constructor
    ``f = types.FunctionType(code, globals, name, argdefs, closure)``,
    closure will not be able to contain the yet-to-be-created f.

    In Python3.7, cell_contents is writeable, so setting the contents of a cell
    can be done simply using
    >>> cell.cell_contents = value

    In earlier Python3 versions, the cell_contents attribute of a cell is read
    only, but this limitation can be worked around by leveraging the Python 3
    ``nonlocal`` keyword.

    In Python2 however, this attribute is read only, and there is no
    ``nonlocal`` keyword. For this reason, we need to come up with more
    complicated hacks to set this attribute.

    The chosen approach is to create a function with a STORE_DEREF opcode,
    which sets the content of a closure variable. Typically:

    >>> def inner(value):
    ...     lambda: cell  # the lambda makes cell a closure
    ...     cell = value  # cell is a closure, so this triggers a STORE_DEREF

    (Note that in Python2, A STORE_DEREF can never be triggered from an inner
    function. The function g for example here
    >>> def f(var):
    ...     def g():
    ...         var += 1
    ...     return g

    will not modify the closure variable ``var```inplace, but instead try to
    load a local variable var and increment it. As g does not assign the local
    variable ``var`` any initial value, calling f(1)() will fail at runtime.)

    Our objective is to set the value of a given cell ``cell``. So we need to
    somewhat reference our ``cell`` object into the ``inner`` function so that
    this object (and not the smoke cell of the lambda function) gets affected
    by the STORE_DEREF operation.

    In inner, ``cell`` is referenced as a cell variable (an enclosing variable
    that is referenced by the inner function). If we create a new function
    cell_set with the exact same code as ``inner``, but with ``cell`` marked as
    a free variable instead, the STORE_DEREF will be applied on its closure -
    ``cell``, which we can specify explicitly during construction! The new
    cell_set variable thus actually sets the contents of a specified cell!

    Note: we do not make use of the ``nonlocal`` keyword to set the contents of
    a cell in early python3 versions to limit possible syntax errors in case
    test and checker libraries decide to parse the whole file.

        # storing all reducers implemented by cloudpickle, but the attribute
        # name was not a great choice given because it would collide with a
        # similarly named attribute in the pure-Python `pickle._Pickler`
        # implementation in the standard library.

        def reducer_override(self, obj):
            """Type-agnostic reducing callback for function and classes.

            For performance reasons, subclasses of the C `pickle.Pickler` class
            cannot register custom reducers for functions and classes in the
            dispatch_table attribute. Reducers for such types must instead
            implemented via the special `reducer_override` method.

            Note that this method will be called for any object except a few
            builtin-types (int, lists, dicts etc.), which differs from reducers
            in the Pickler's dispatch_table, each of them being invoked for
            objects of a specific type only.

            This property comes in handy for classes: although most classes are
            instances of the ``type`` metaclass, some of them can be instances
            of other custom metaclasses (such as enum.EnumMeta for example). In
            particular, the metaclass will likely not be known in advance, and
            thus cannot be special-cased using an entry in the dispatch_table.
            reducer_override, among other things, allows us to register a
            reducer that will be called for any class, independently of its
            type.

            Notes:

            * reducer_override has the priority over dispatch_table-registered
            reducers.
            * reducer_override can be used to fix other limitations of
              cloudpickle for other types that suffered from type-specific
              reducers, such as Exceptions. See
              https://github.com/cloudpipe/cloudpickle/issues/248
